# Pokemon 3

This project is made so I could learn more about `Unity Engine` and mostly *important*
good project ***architecture***.

I set myself the goal that a *class cannot have more than **100** lines*.

By doing so the code is more easily refactored and bugs can be more quickly found.

Also I tried to use a more *Event* based approach, to make not only the code more *scalable*, 
but also because it was a easy way to *offset logic* to another class :)
